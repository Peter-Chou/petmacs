;;; Commentary:
;; This script is largely forked from [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/core/core-keybindings.el][spacemacs/core/core-keybindings.el]] and is
;; intended to be a replication of spacemacs' leader key features, without
;; requiring all of spacemacs into your configuration.
;;
;; My complete respect goes to the developers of spacemacs who created the most
;; ergonomic and responsive binding system I've ever seen :)

;;; Code:

(require 'seq)
(require 'dash)
;; TODO remove dependence on general.el
(require 'general)
(require 'bind-map)
(require 'bind-key)

instead of binding a map to '%s'. By default this is set to
behave exactly like spacemacs does.

This'll probably be quicker and less memory intensive, but you
won't recieve any key assistance through `leader-major-mode-key'
because a simulated key is actually a command, and not a prefix.

Notable changes when setting this option are:
* if your major-mode has no leader keys, the default binding for
  '%s' will be run, instead of an empty prefix message being issued.
* if you press '%s' `which-key' will show your input as '%s %s'
  instead of as '%s'.
* `substitute-command-keys' won't show any bindings accessed through
  '%s'. This'll be most noticeable in `org-capture' or `org-edit-src-code'.
